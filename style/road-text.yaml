# This messy filter could be done with a [step, [zoom], ..., N, ...] but this
# would require re-stating the conditions for all lower zoom for each step.
# Instead, it requires one of the any branches is met, and each branch involves
# a zoom level conditional. If the zoom-level part is omitted, the results look
# odd when zooming in and out.
