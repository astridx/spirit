# Street Spirit style

## About

Street Spirit aims to be a general purpose map style for OpenStreetMap data, using client-side rendering and vector tiles. It is starting from a mostly fresh start, taking advantage of the decade of lessons in designing an open source stylesheet in [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

## Installing

Installation instructions are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
